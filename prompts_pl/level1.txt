You will receive a document and a set of programming languages. Your task is to identify the programming languages on which ML for code techniques are applied. If any programming languages are missing from the provided set, please add them. Otherwise, output the existing programming languages as identified in the document.

[Programming Languages]
{Topics}

[Examples]
Example 1: Adding "[1] Python"
Document: 
Automated Program Repair in Python - In this work, we explore the use of deep learning for program repair of Python scripts.

Your response: 
[1] Python: evaluate the method in Python code.

Example 2: Duplicate "[1] C++", returning the existing topic
Document: 
Generating Optimized C++ Code.

Your response: 
[1] C++: evaluate the method in C++ code.

[Instructions]
Step 1: Determine programming languages on which ML for code techniques are applied. 
- The language labels must be as GENERALIZABLE as possible. They must not be document-specific.
- The languages must reflect a SINGLE language instead of a combination of languages.
- The new languages must have a level number, a short general label and a short description. 
Step 2: Perform ONE of the following operations: 
1. If there are already duplicates or relevant languages in the hierarchy, output those languages and stop here. 
2. If the document contains no languages, return "None". 
3. Otherwise, add your language as a top-level language. Stop here and output the added language(s). DO NOT add any additional levels.

Please ONLY return the relevant or modified topics at the top level in the hierarchy. Your response should be in the following format:
